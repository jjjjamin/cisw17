    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 1: Understanding How the Web Works</h2>
    <p>The first chapter of the book describes the basics and origins of Hypertext Markerup Language (HTML). One of the important takeways
        is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are combined to create the content of a website. HTML creates the foundation, CSS affects the design 
        and appearance, and JavaScript sets the logic for the behavior of the pages. Webpages and web content also differ in meaning. Web
        content also includes other elements such as image and audio. I also learned that in order to view the content, we have to request
        on the device we're using, which will allow us to retreive and display the information. The logisitics of web hosting and management
        were big talking points too. There are many factors to consider when finding the best web hosting provider, such as price, bandwith,
        customer service, and reliability. I also got a preview of how we can transfer our files to the web server by using an FTP client like
        Cyberduck. There are a lot of intricacies when formatting and evaluting your Webpage, like testing in multiple browsers and devices
        and writing in a valid standards-compliant code.

    <h2>Lesson 2: Structuring an HTML Document</h2>
    <p>Lesson 2 dove into more of the basics on HTML structure and semantics. A great section of the chapter was understanding what are the 
        necessary tags to include in every single HTML document. It also expains some of the basic tags, their function, and reason to use 
        them within our documents. There are many ways to format our HTML without even needing CSS at this point, including line breaks, ]
        horizontal rules, headings, and even lists. I think one of my favorite sections was learning how the navbar and footer works within
        the code, especially as a UX Designer. I've had experience with crafting them within Figma, but to see how they function within code
        is really intresting. I also found the difference between using the aside or section tags to be really helpful as it was a slightly 
        confusing concept previously. Section is a really great to tool to segment different parts of a single web page. Lastly, the use and
        good practice of headings is really helpful. I was even able to format more of my notes in a more effective way, choosing only 1 h1
        header and keep moving doen the hierarchy.
