    <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Lesson 6: Working with Fonts, Text Blocks, Lists, and Tables</h2>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">This section introduced us to the different style options we can implement within our HTML code. An interesting note to start with is that the line &lt;meta charset  = "utf-8"&gt; reduces the need for more of these special codes. There are lot of custom charactrers that can be achieved using the ampersand symbol within the code. We also learned about using boldface, italic, and other special text formatting options to emphasize certain paragpraphs of our work. There are multiple ways to say the same thing, but it's a better practice to use &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; over &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;. We also learned about the ability to tweak the text using a different font family, font size, and even color. A lot of the customization could be done within the style sheet within the CSS as well as on the HTML file itself.

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">
    I read about creating lists and how we can have both a numbered and unumbered list. We're also able to nest a list within another list. Another thing we covered this section was learning how to used rows and columns together to create tables. These tables are great for showcasing different categorized information in a really digestible manner. There also tags to help modify them even more, including the spacing, alignment, and overall look of the tables. We also learned about CSS columns. We should use them for more of a layout purpose instead of the tables for displaying information.

    <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Lesson 7: Using External and Internal Links</h2>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">One of the most important components of our web page are the links displayed throughout them. These links can be used to redirect someone to multiple paths, internally and externally. To create a link within your web page, you have to use the &lt;a&gt; tag, making the hypertext "hyper." With that you can set the link to different parts of your page, known as anchor points. We also learned that when setting these links for other web pages, we have to also include "href" within the &lt;a&gt; tag. If we wanted to link within our own page, we would just include the filename within the directory.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">There are other uses and things we can link with the &lt;a&gt; tag. We can allow people visiting our web page to have a direct link to email us, even customizing it to include a premade subject line and body text. We can link direct downloads to different files, including .pdf and .png. We can even have an image set up to be the actual link within the page. One of the biggest takeaways is to have our links stand out when compared to the rest of the body text. We need to have different ways to signify their importance, from changing their color, making them bold, or even underlining them. We can also add more effects like a hover and visited state.

    <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Lesson 8: Working Colors, Images, and Multimedia</h2>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">The final lesson this weeks going into depth about color and being effective with its utilization. One thing we can use is a color wheel to find colors that compliment our primary color. I also liked the incorporation and need of accessibility within our designs so we can create something for everyone. As far as customization goes, we saw how to use RBG as well asthe hexcode to set the specific color we want to display on our web page. We can apply those colors to different elements, like background, text color, and even borders using the CSS. We also learned the basics of incorporating images into our website. There are a couple of design softwares we can use to edit those images to better fit our website as well. When adding an image to our web page, there a lot of factors to consdier, such as the size, resolution, placement, and opacity of the image. 
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Once we learned the use and importance of adding images to our web page, we learned how to actually add them within our code. The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to add the said image and we are able to even add in text that will appear when hovering over the image with a mouse. It can be seen as the alternative text to the image. We also learned other factors that can affect the overall look of the image, such as alignment, image wrapping, and more. We can also make the image a link by adding the &lt;a&gt; tag, as said in an earlier lesson. I also learned about adding video and sound into our web page. We're able to achieve this by &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;, and &lt;source&gt;.
