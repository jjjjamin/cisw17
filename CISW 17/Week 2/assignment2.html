    <p>Hello! Hello! I'm Jamin Nick. As a student, I am a huge fan of collaboration, going back 
        all the way to high school, where my friends and I would spend countless hours crafting 
        group our presentations and videos. I've had the oppurtunity to study Human-Computer 
        Interaction at UC - San Diego where I worked on even more collaborative projects as a 
        UX Designer, from a Zoom App redesign to a physical kiosk and app promoting local music shows in 
        the San Diego area. I hope to keep honing and refining my overall skills by learning front-end development.

        <p>I'm only taking CISW 17 - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this semester. However, I'm very 
        interested in the class CISW 81, Work Experience in Web Programming!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a HUGE music lover. There would be periods where I attend concerts multiple times 
            a week. My favorite events are Sound and Fury Festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, and Coachella.
            When I'm not attending shows, I love to play the drums and guitar and curate multiple 
            playlists on Spotify. Right now, I'm listening to Clairo's Charm and Failure's Fantastic Planet. 
            Here's a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3OKi2FnVNuBoLtXBQKEMOB?si=1fb61a98045a4ab5/">
            personal playlist!</a> I also am a huge fan of the outdoors and fitness. I try to rock 
            climb every week and go on hikes or expeditions with my friends to all of the National 
            Parks when possible. Let me know you have any interests in these topics:
