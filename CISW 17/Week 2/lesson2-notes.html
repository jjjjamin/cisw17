    <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Lesson 3: Understanding Cascading Style Sheets</h2>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">This section was an introduction to CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets.
                                       CSS controls the display of our web content. Styling and style sheets can be 
                                       created and established in multiple ways that "cascade." The hierarchy goes from
                                       from a broad range of elements on an external style sheet to a very specific attribute 
                                       with in-line styling. The style sheet gives us a lot of control when formatting the 
                                       appearance of our webpage, including layout and formatting properties. Layout properties
                                       include positional elements of a page like padding and alignment. Formatting properties 
                                       deal with the visual aspects within a page, such as color and font size. You can style 
                                       basically every HTML tag, even within the same HTML file instead of a separate .css file.

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">As stated previously, there are multiple ways to style your webpage. One of the first ways
                                       we learned about was creating a separate style sheet file using the .css extension and linking
                                       it in our HTML file. Another way is to create a &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; of our 
                                       HTML file. You can also use the &lt;style&gt; tag within an HTML tag. In a similar vein, we 
                                       can style specific attributes to different HTML tags using inline styles, allowing it to override
                                       the intial .css style sheet. We also learned that we can use style classes and style IDs. Style
                                       classes is a custom set of styling attributes that can be used for any element in our page. We can 
                                       have multiple classes within the same page. A style ID is a custom set of styling attributes, but   
                                       it can only be applied to one element in a page.
