    <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Lesson 4: Understanding JavaScript</h2>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">This section began explaining the fundamentals and reasonings for using JavaScript within a web page. JavaScript is a language that allows us to make interactive web pages with HTML and CSS. Unlike other languages that must be compiled, JavScript is an interpreted lanaguge, executing each line of script as it gets to it. Each change is enacted as soon as the document is reloaded. I learned that you can place the &lt;script&gt; tag in multiple places within your HTML as well as linking it on its on .js extension file. 
                                        
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">
    Using JavaScript allows you to set the different functions that a user can interact with your page, like deciding what a button will when clicked or hovered on. Some other examples include, improving naviagtion, special effects, and validating forms. You can even store data in variables, strings, and arrays within JavaScript, although we mainly learned about storing data in variables in this lesson. To test our scripts, we just have to load the HTML document within the web page just like how we would test our HTML code. You can even configure your browser to display any js error messages so your can run diagnostics that way.

    <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Lesson 5: Validating and Debugging Your Code</h2>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Bugs and errors happen with everyone's code, whether they're a beginner or seasoned coder, but it is imperative to learn how to debug them, especially when working with a client. One of the intial ways to validating your website is to test it. The next step is actually validating the code, most times using special applications that look for errors while making sure the code also adheres to HTML and CSS standards. One of the examples included the website Validator. You can even use it when you've already published your page online. Another way to debug your code is by using the developer tools on different web browsers.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">The developer tools are a great way to have a closer look at your code because sometimes, everything will show up looking fine. However, when looking at the final design, we might see something causing an issue. When working the developer tools, we can find all the details that can be causing a specific issue to be present and fix it. You can even fix JavaScript code through the Cosole tab.

    <h3 style="font-family: Helvetica;">How To Include JavaScript in a Web Page</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">
    If you want to add the JavaScript within an HMTL file, you need to first add opening and closing &lt;script&gt; tags within the file itself. There are different places you can add the &lt;script&gt; tags
        <ul>
            <li>In the body</li>
            <li>In the header, neyween the &lt;head&gt; tags</li>
            <li>Within an HTML tag</li>
            <li>In a separate file using a .js extension</li>
        </ul>    
    </p>
